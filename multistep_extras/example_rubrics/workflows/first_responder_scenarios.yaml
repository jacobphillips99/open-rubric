      answer: 0.0
      reasoning: Patient is not breathing and requires immediate respiratory support
    emergency_protocols:
      answer: 1.0

    initial_assessment:
      answer: 0.0
      reasoning: Patient is unconscious and not breathing, requiring immediate life

    scene_safety:
      answer: 1.0
      reasoning: The residential street has no visible hazards, electrical wires,
        fire, or aggressive bystanders
  completion: First, I'll check if the scene is safe. Since there are no visible hazards,
    I'll proceed. The patient is unconscious and not breathing, so I'll immediately
    check their airway and begin CPR. I'll call for advanced life support and continue
    resuscitation efforts.

      reasoning: Vehicle is safely positioned on the shoulder away from traffic hazards
    transport_decision:
      answer: 1.0
      reasoning: Patient prepared for hospital transport after bleeding control
    trauma_check:
      answer: 1.0
      reasoning: Visible deep laceration on left arm with heavy bleeding identified
  completion: After confirming scene safety and ensuring no traffic hazards, I'll
    approach the patient. They're alert and responsive, so I'll introduce myself and
    explain what I'm doing. I'll immediately apply direct pressure to the arm wound
    to control bleeding while simultaneously assessing their vital signs and checking
    for other injuries. Once bleeding is controlled, I'll gather their medical history
    and symptoms, then prepare them for transport to the hospital.

    immobilization:
      answer: 1.0
      reasoning: Patient carefully immobilized in position due to suspected hip fracture
    initial_assessment:
      answer: 1.0
      reasoning: Patient is awake, oriented, and able to communicate

    scene_safety:
      answer: 1.0
      reasoning: Bathroom environment is secure with no ongoing hazards
    transport_preparation:
      answer: 1.0
      reasoning: Patient prepared for transport with comfort measures
    trauma_check:
      answer: 1.0
      reasoning: Fall mechanism with audible 'pop' and inability to move leg indicates
        trauma
  completion: After ensuring scene safety, I'll assess their level of consciousness
    - they're alert and oriented. Given the mechanism of injury (fall), their age,
    the severe hip pain, inability to move the leg, and the audible 'pop', I strongly
    suspect a hip fracture. I'll assess their current pain level, provide initial
    pain management if within my scope, and carefully immobilize them in position
    before any movement. I'll prepare them for transport while providing comfort measures.
