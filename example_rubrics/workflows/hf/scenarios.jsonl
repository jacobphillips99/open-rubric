{"question": "{\"_hidden_description\": \"On a busy urban roadway during evening rush hour, a multi-vehicle collision has resulted in several injured individuals. The scene involves overturned vehicles, leaking fuel, shattered glass, and debris scattered across multiple lanes, creating a hazardous environment with risk of fire, explosion, and further injuries. The first responder arrives to find three victims: one unconscious driver trapped inside a vehicle, one conscious pedestrian with visible leg lacerations, and another unresponsive cyclist on the roadside. Scene safety is a priority due to ongoing traffic, potential fire hazards, and unstable vehicles. The responder first secures the scene, ensuring no additional hazards, and evaluates each patient. The unconscious driver shows no response, with no airway obstruction but signs of severe trauma, including visible bleeding and deformity. The responder performs initial assessment: airway management is critical; airway is patent but at risk, so airway protection is performed. Breathing is inadequate, prompting the initiation of breathing support measures like supplemental oxygen and assisted ventilation if needed. Circulatory status is checked: the driver has a weak pulse; bleeding control is performed on visible wounds. The conscious pedestrian reports severe leg pain; trauma check reveals open lacerations and suspected fractures; immobilization and bleeding control are applied. The unresponsive cyclist is checked for responsiveness, airway, breathing, and circulation, with immediate interventions including airway opening, rescue breaths, and bleeding control. Scene hazards are continuously monitored, emergency protocols are activated, and triage is performed to prioritize transport: the unconscious driver and cyclist are stabilized and prepared for rapid extrication and transport, while the pedestrian's injuries are managed on scene. Medical history is limited, but observations and injury assessments are thorough.
