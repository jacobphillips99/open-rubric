    2 meters. The responder notes the scene is stable, with no immediate hazards.
    The patient has no pulse or respiratory effort initially, indicating cardiac arrest.
    Scene safety is confirmed. The responder approaches and performs an initial assessment,
    noting unresponsiveness, no airway patency, and inadequate breathing. No visible
    trauma is evident. Vital signs are unstable with no pulse or breathing. The responder
    performs immediate airway management, providing rescue breaths and CPR. No bleeding
    or trauma signs are present. After intervention, circulation is checked; pulses
    are absent. The responder activates emergency protocols, initiating advanced life
    support. The patient is stabilized with airway and breathing interventions, and
    arrangements are made for rapid transport to the hospital. Medical history is
    unobtainable due to unresponsiveness. Scene hazards are minimal, and the responder

    at a busy urban intersection during daylight hours. The scene shows a mangled
    vehicle with airbags deployed, and the driver is slumped over the steering wheel,
    unresponsive to verbal stimuli. The environment has nearby traffic, pedestrians,
    and debris on the road. Emergency services arrived 5 minutes after the crash.
    The driver is not breathing spontaneously; no pulse is detectable. There are visible
    signs of chest deformity and bleeding from facial injuries. No scene hazards are
    immediately apparent, but traffic remains active. The driver has a known history
    of hypertension and was reportedly driving under the influence. The scene is safe
    to approach after traffic control measures are established. Initial assessment
    confirms unresponsiveness, airway is obstructed by blood and debris, and breathing
    is inadequate. Immediate airway management is necessary. Vital signs are unstable;
    no pulse, and breathing is insufficient. There are significant facial and chest
    injuries, with bleeding controlled temporarily with dressings. The scene requires

- _hidden_description: 'On a busy urban roadway during evening rush hour, a multi-vehicle
    collision has resulted in several injured individuals. The scene involves overturned
    vehicles, leaking fuel, shattered glass, and debris scattered across multiple
    lanes, creating a hazardous environment with risk of fire, explosion, and further
    injuries. The first responder arrives to find three victims: one unconscious driver
    trapped inside a vehicle, one conscious pedestrian with visible leg lacerations,
    and another unresponsive cyclist on the roadside. Scene safety is a priority due
    to ongoing traffic, potential fire hazards, and unstable vehicles. The responder
    first secures the scene, ensuring no additional hazards, and evaluates each patient.
    The unconscious driver shows no response, with no airway obstruction but signs
    of severe trauma, including visible bleeding and deformity. The responder performs
    initial assessment: airway management is critical; airway is patent but at risk,
    so airway protection is performed. Breathing is inadequate, prompting the initiation
    of breathing support measures like supplemental oxygen and assisted ventilation
    if needed. Circulatory status is checked: the driver has a weak pulse; bleeding
    control is performed on visible wounds. The conscious pedestrian reports severe
    leg pain; trauma check reveals open lacerations and suspected fractures; immobilization
    and bleeding control are applied. The unresponsive cyclist is checked for responsiveness,
    airway, breathing, and circulation, with immediate interventions including airway
    opening, rescue breaths, and bleeding control. Scene hazards are continuously
    monitored, emergency protocols are activated, and triage is performed to prioritize
    transport: the unconscious driver and cyclist are stabilized and prepared for
    rapid extrication and transport, while the pedestrian''s injuries are managed
    on scene. Medical history is limited, but observations and injury assessments
    are thorough. The responder ensures scene safety, performs trauma assessments,
    manages airway, breathing, circulation, bleeding, immobilization, and makes transport
    decisions accordingly.'
