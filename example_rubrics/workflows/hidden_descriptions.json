    "hidden_description": "On a rainy afternoon, a car has collided with a utility pole at a rural intersection. The vehicle's airbags deployed, and the driver, a 45-year-old male, is conscious but confused, with visible bleeding from a laceration on his forehead. The scene is initially safe, with no fire or hazardous materials present, but the road is slippery. The patient is responsive but disoriented, able to communicate pain and confusion. Vital signs are not yet checked, but the patient\u2019s pulse appears rapid. No obvious trauma to limbs or torso is visible, but a dented door suggests possible internal injuries. The emergency services arrived 5 minutes ago. The patient is alert but complaining of severe headache and neck pain. Scene safety is confirmed; initial assessment of consciousness is ongoing; vital signs are pending. The patient exhibits visible bleeding, and immobilization of the neck is necessary. No major bleeding is controlled yet, and airway is patent but should be monitored. The scene's hazards are minimal, but the patient's condition requires prompt immobilization and transport decision. Emergency protocols are being followed, and the patient needs to be transported to the nearest trauma center.
